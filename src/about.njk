education: 
  title: <b>University</b> Education
  text: I have <b>Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology</b>, from Academy of Professional Studies in Serbia. I have studied Information Technology and gained educational title <b>IT engineer</b>.

exp:
  - I have a decade of experience in web development, working on all kind of projects, from brochure type websites, to e-commerce and directory/classifieds types of projects. 
  - I have worked with most popular CMS like wordpress, joomla, opencart etc... And have a lot of experience working with ProcessWire CMS/CMF, building advanced content structures, front-end, modules, custom admin pages etc...
  - "Not just coding, my experience on the web goes beyond just writing the code. During the years i have done everything that comes along with building and managing websites: design and development, deployments and hosting, servers and dns, git and integrations, working with graphics, photoshop etc... "

stack:
  "I have preference for front-end development and my main tech stack is: <b>HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP</b>. I can work with any traditional or headless content management systems, but prefer php based CMS with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with pre-processors and libraries like htmx and sometimes vue.js and nuxt.js."

tech:
  - title: ProcessWire
    text: Is always my first CMS of choice. It's a secure, stable and powerful platform with great API. It's speeds up my development process and help me build fast and performant solutions that scales very well.
  - title: WordPress
    text: As most popular CMS, wordpress is also in my stack. I try to avoid page builders, and usually develop websites from scratch rather than using pre-made themes. But, if project and client require a specific theme, i would be comfortable implementing and customizing it...
  - title: E-Commerce
    text: For e-commerce type of projects, my default platform of choice is <b>WooCommerce</b>, and <b>SnipCart</b> for static websites. For more scalable solutions, would look into Shopware or Shopify.
  - title: JAMstack
    text: "I love working with modern static site generators like: 11ty, astro or nuxt. Using them to build super-fast static websites in combination with github, cloudflare pages and netlify services. When there is no need for advanced content management features, static websites are perfect solution. Easy to host and deploy with no maintenance costs."
  - title: UIkit & TailwindCSS
    text: As a front-end developer i write a lot of css, usually with less and sass pre-processors, and i like doing it. But, In order to speed up development processes, i often use css front-end frameworks. <br /> I can work basically with any existing css framework out there. When working with a CMS i mainly use UIkit, and when working with static site generators and JAMstack, i prefer TailwindCSS.
