## Front-End Development
Front-end development using modern tech and tools. I prefer using Uikit framework, less css preprocessor, vanilla JavaScript and Nuxt.js for SSG and SSR.

## Content Managament System (CMS)
Development with, and for open-source or proprietary CMS, based on a project requirements, but with a preference for ProcessWire CMS.

## ProcessWire CMS/CMF
ProcessWire is an open source CMS and web application framework. With years of expiriance on building websites, modules, integrations, custom admin pages and interfaces... it is easy recommendation for most of the projects.

## Static Websites
Super fast static websites with nuxt.js, github and netlify. Easy to deploy and manage, with very low maintaince costs. Git based content managament with makrdown files or pulling data from the APIs.

## Design Implementation
I can code your designs. If you are designer or have ready made designs, i can implement them for you as static pages on with CMS integration. Converting your designs and wireframes into fully functional websites.
