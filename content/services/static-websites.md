  Nuxt: 
    title: Nuxt.js
    text: For building static websites i use nuxt.js, with the nuxt-content module and markdown files. Alternatively we can pull the data from any API end-point, and skip using markdown files.

  GitHub:

    text: Like for everything, there are downsides. Not ideal if the content is highly dynamic or user-specific. Needs a rebuild when we want to show different or new data. Content managament can be a not-so-user-friendly.
