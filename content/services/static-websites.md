    title: Low Costs
    text: For static websites there is no server needed. They can be deployed on github and netlify, and both services are free. This makes static websites easy to maintain with zero costs for hosting services.

  Nuxt: 
    title: Nuxt.js
    text: For building static websites i use nuxt.js, with the nuxt-content module and markdown files. Additionally we can pull the data (content) from any API end-point, and skip using local files.

  GitHub: 
    title: Git
    text: Eather using git based content or pulling data from the APIs, static website will be pushed to GitHub. This way we are getting all of the Git benifits, version control, development collaboration etc... 

  Netlify:
    title: Deployment 
    text: Static websites are deployed on free platforms like Netlify, with zero maintaince costs. All you need is a domain name to connect it to the netlify service.

  Cons:
    title: Con's
    text: Like with everything, there are downsides. Not ideal if the content is highly dynamic or user-specific. Needs a rebuild when we want to show different or new data. Content managament can be a not-so-user-friendly if not connected with a CMS.

  Conclusion:
    title: Is static website for you?
    text: If you dont need a dynamic content, and you dont need to manage and change your content often, YES, having a static website would be a good choise.
